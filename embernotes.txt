routes:
we would like the page to be served on the /about URL. In order
to do this, we will need to tell Ember about our plan to add a page
at that location. Otherwise, Ember will think we have visited an invalid URL!

The map() method of your Ember application's router can be
 invoked to define URL mappings. When calling map(), you
 should pass a function that will be invoked with the value
  this set to an object which you can use to create routes.
Ex :
Router.map(function() {
  this.route('about', { path: '/about' });
  this.route('favorites', { path: '/favs' });
});

Now, when the user visits /about, Ember will render the about
template. Visiting /favs will render the favorites template.

You can leave off the path if it is the same as the route name.
 In this case, the following is equivalent to the above example

Router.map(function() {
  this.route('about');
  this.route('favorites', { path: '/favs' });
});

inside our templates we can use
<link To @route="routename">
link to routename
</linkTo>


ex : Router.map(function() {
  this.route('blog_post', { path: '/blog-post' });
});

now <linkTo @route="blog_post">dfdf<linkTo>
route  template will be /blog-post
template will be blog_post
